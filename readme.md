# Predict Best Fit Model for medical datset
### Introduction
This is a machine learning project which was focused on analyzing the data from the given dataset here used “Medical Cost Dataset”, by using various machine learning algorithms and on the basis of that predict which algorithm is best fitted enough to provide lowest error for the dataset. Here I have used algorithms like Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, SVM, and Gradient Boosting on the dataset and concluded the best algorithm on basis of Average RMSE calculated by model building.
